`minigh` is a thin wrapper around [`ureq`](https://crates.io/crates/ureq) for
interacting with the GitHub REST API that aims to make common operations easier
& simpler.  Notable features include:

- When making a request, you only need to specify the part of the URL after the
  API base URL.

- Support for iterating over paginated results

- Most request methods return decoded JSON.

- Bring Your Own Schema: `minigh` does not define any types for values returned
  by the API; that is left up to the user.

- Errors raised for 4xx and 5xx responses include the body of the response in
  the error value, and this body is included when displaying with `{:#}`.

- The `Accept` and `X-GitHub-Api-Version` headers are automatically set to
  their recommended values.

- Follows [GitHub's recommendations for dealing with rate limits][ratelimit],
  including waiting between mutating requests and waiting & retrying in
  response to rate-limit errors

- Automatic retrying on 5xx errors with exponential backoff
